# hello-world
This is my very first repository!

I'm Ian, a man who always seems to be busy - a good thing, yes - but am I busy doing what I should be doing, or am I a busy fool? 

My life is spent with my beautiful fianc√© and two cats. I travel between Nottingham and London to work and I'm frantically saving for a new house so we can put down some roots and build a home together. 

I have a business and three mortgages so things are far from 'secure' but I like it like that. I think that risks need to be taken nowadays if you want a solid future. I could be wrong but I hope not, besides it's better to have tried and failed than to never have tried at all!

Bye!!
